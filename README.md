publically available data.

# Background

[Topolinski and Sparenberg](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550611419266) (2012, press
release in German [here](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/sonstiges/meldungen/single/artikel/wer-mit-de/)) 
report that 
clockwise movements induce psychological states of temporal 
progression and an orientation toward the future and novelty.

Among other experiments, they tested whether self--reported experiential 
openness is influenced by rotational movements.

The authors use the "Openness to Experience" subscale from the
"Neuroticism -- Extroversion -- Openness" personality inventory ([NEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory#Personality_dimensions))
for their study. 

They found that participants who turn kitchen rolls clockwise 
report more openness to new experiences (Experiment 2 in their paper),
if one controls for mood and arousal.  

In 2015 [Wagenmakers et. al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00494) 
published a replications study that could not
confirm these results.

The full data are available at <https://osf.io/uszvx/>, and as part of the JASP 
program with the name `Kitchen_Rolls.csv`.
